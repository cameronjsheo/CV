<h3>I'm a B.Sc. in Information Technology Graduate.</h3>
<p>
  I have recently completed my studies at North West University and will receive my official degree in June this year. 
  I am very grateful that I was given the opportunity and also very honoured to have passed my degree with distinction. 
  My university experience has been challenging, I have gained a lot of knowledge during these past three years and have 
  had my fair share of ups and downs. I am currently trying to broaden my understanding on information security as a whole
  and would love the opportunity to enhance my skillset.</p>
<br>
<p>I am a quick and fast learner who can absorb new information effectively and can communicate clearly. 
  I possess good bonding skills and have an inquiring mind that is eager to broaden my knowledge and grow as an individual.
  I have a fascination with building websites, database management systems, general applications and cybersecurity, and
  I always strive for a high degree in accuracy and attention to detail. I am currently in a cybersecurity internship with Altron Bytes Solutions 
  where I've learned many aspects regarding cloud and information security. 
<br>
<br>
My current interests are in video games, I absolutely love modifying games, currently trying to create some of my own mods. 
I find artificial intelligence fascinating and the idea of allowing machines to "think for themselves". 
I also enjoy computer assembly, even though some of the prices for components are way beyond my budget.
<br>
<br>
I like fishing, because even if I don't catch anything, its' still very relaxing and peaceful if no one steals my fishing spot. 
Finally, I enjoy socializing & traveling, as I am always eager to make new friendships along the way. 
Overall, I am passionate about technology. I would love to be given the opportunity to learn more about it.</p>
